### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

## WHO AM I?
I'm Fauzaan, I'm into design and code.

## MY FOCUS
I work on telegram bots, Websites, Apps, python scripts, Social Media Automation and webautomation in general, However my focus is on solving the problem rather than focusing on a specefic stack or a technology. Because I'm a firm believer that the end result is what matters. Not the tools you use it to achieve it. (unless what you achieve is not actually solving the problem)

## HOW IT STARTED
- I had my basics while I was in primary school.

`(7th grade) from w3schools and codeacademy (HTML, CSS, JS)`

----------------

- Got into Forex through a good friend
- helped his ideas be converted into autotrading bots and tools

`As I already had the basics of programming concepts from JS, it was easy to pickup C# and MQL`

---------
- Started fauzaan.xyz which gave the service of coding tools based on any Trading Strategy

`This was done for an year until I attempted a Degree in Islamic Finance`

-----------
- I mastered both Photoshop and Illustrator
- I did some Social Media Marketing as paid & voluntary work for several businesses

` Still offering this paid service in my freetime`

-----------

## CURRENTLY . . .

- Learning various frameworks, concepts, etc.. through workshops on FrontendMasters 
> Thanks to the Github Student Developer Pack
> 
-------

- Espeacilly interested in SVG animations, 
> Mainly because I know illustrator well enough to create them and they are just **amazing**

## WORK WITH ME?

I am looking to contribute to any project if I do have the ability to understand the code. 
> I can only try If I like it...

> I can help with documentation and graphics as well
