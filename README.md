### Hello World ðŸ‘‹


## whoami?
I'm Fauzaan, I'm into design and code.

## My Focus
I work on telegram bots, Websites, Apps, python scripts, Social Media Automation and webautomation in general, However my focus is on solving the problem rather than focusing on a specefic stack or a technology. Because I'm a firm believer that the end result is what matters. Not the tools you use it to achieve it. (unless what you achieve is not actually solving the problem)

## How I got into coding
I had my basics while I was in primary school. (7th grade) from w3schools and codeacademy (HTML, CSS, JS) 

After a while I got into Forex through a good friend and helped his ideas be converted into automated trading bots and tools. As I already had the basics of programming concepts from JS, it was easy to pickup C# and MQL (MQL is a language based on C++ for Metatrader Platform)

Then I started fauzaan.xyz which gave the service of coding Indicators, Trading Robots based on any Trading Strategy anyone has. This was done for an year until I attempted a Degree in Islamic Finance.

Later on I mastered both Photoshop and Illustrator helping me make any kind of graphics I need for any project. I did some Social Media Marketing as paid work, and voluntarily as well for businesses started by my Friends.

Now I'm focusing on Learning new Frameworks, Languages and really get into Development combining all of the skills I have gathered starting all the way from 7th Grade (HTML, CSS & JS)

## WORK WITH ME?

I am looking to contribute to any open source projects if I do have the ability to understand the code. (I can only try If I like it...)
I can help with documentation and graphics as well.

## CURRENTLY . . .

Im Learning various frameworks, concepts, etc.. through workshops on FrontendMasters Thanks to the Github Student Developer Pack
Im espeacilly interested in SVG animations, Mainly because I know illustrator well enough to create them and they are just amazing.
