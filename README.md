### Stop managing time, and start managing your focus.


Winning doesn’t care if you have time. It expects you to **make time**, because **nothing is more important.**

> Time is undefeated. No matter what you do, it will outlast you, outsmart you, and paralyze you—if you allow it to.
> 
> You can’t control it. But you can control its hold on you… by controlling your focus on the end result.
